This repository include teaching materials for the PhD-course **Automate your GIS - Scripting in Python** (NGEO306).

A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. Where most of the geoscientific research activities include a spatial component, knowledge and skills on how to effectively process and analyses this kind of information is essential to be a successful researcher. 

Department of Earth Sciences at University of Gothenburg gives a third cycle course on the concept of using basic programming and scripting to process, analyses and visualize spatial processes. The aim of this course is to acquire programming skills and concepts on how to perform auto-mated processing within a GIS. 

This is mostly an on-campus course. The course do not require that you have your own computer but it is recommened. The course is based on Windows 10. Other operating systems such as Linux and iOS is possible but not recommend.
